## Philosophy

This app is built on the principle that small, consistent actions compound over time. Instead of overwhelming yourself with huge task lists, focus on moving each project forward by just one task per day. 

The streak system provides motivation to maintain consistency, while the bonus task system allows for productive days without breaking the sustainable pace.
